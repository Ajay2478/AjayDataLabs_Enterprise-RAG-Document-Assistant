### 🚀 Overview
This is a production-grade **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed to democratize access to document data. Unlike standard chatbots, this system ingests complex PDFs (legal, medical, technical) and provides **citation-backed answers** with zero hallucinations.

It utilizes the **Groq LPU Engine** for sub-second inference and **Google GenAI** for semantic vectorization, orchestrating a split-stack architecture deployed on **Railway** (Backend) and **Vercel** (Frontend).

### ⚡ Key Features (Business ROI)
* **Zero-Hallucination Q&A:** Answers are strictly grounded in the uploaded document using Vector Search (FAISS).
* **Ultra-Low Latency:** Powered by Groq Llama-3 (70B) for instant reasoning.
* **Audit Trail:** Every answer includes a specific **[Page X] citation**, allowing users to verify facts immediately.
* **Hybrid Storage:** Chat history is persisted via SQLite, while vector embeddings are managed in high-performance memory.
* **Accessibility:** Built-in Text-to-Speech synthesis for auditory learning.
